In other for as to work WebStorm and to be able to link it to GitHub, first we must download install Git. Git, Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. First, we have to go to google to search and download Git, the website will give as option for which OS we are going to install Git on, if it is windows or mac or Linux, for example, I use windows, so when I choose windows, it uses the agent browser and show different platform that is suitable for me, weather 32 or 64 bit (choose the correct system for your device). After you have chose the right system for your device Git will provide or show the licenses, after that you click next then it will go ahead with the installation
    Secondly you must Create a GitHub account. GitHub is a source control platform that is used for creating code and committing changes. After you have created GitHub account, you then create a repository account and make the repository public and add the readme file.
    WebStorm is an integrated development environment used for coding. After you have download WebStorm, you create repository account, you then go to VCS (version control System) menu, Import into Version Control or select the enable version control integration. Now you need to commit the change to Git, after you have committed and link Git to WebStorm it will show at the fall left corner indicating that Git has been link to WebStorm. Now that you have link Git to WebStorm, you need to create a new file, you right click the file and add it to Git after that you need to commit them to save the changes. After you have finish committing the file, you push it to GitHub. On WebStorm you search for share project to GitHub, when you share your project to GitHub, it will show that it has been successfully share to GitHub, you click on the link, it will take you to the GitHub repository browser. Now your file is on GitHub you go to setting and setup GitHub page where you will design and hold personal or organization project.
















**Branch:** Branch is use for maintaining version control of code\
**Clone:** Clone is when you copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine. Clone repository from GitHub to your local machine also make it easy to fix merge conflict.\
**Commit:** Commit make changes to one or more files in the branch. Commit tells the history of your repository, it tells when a change has been made.\
**Fetch:** Fetch is used to see what every body is working on, fetch download commit, files from the repository to the local repository\
**GIT:** is an open success system distribution that act as a tracker which track ang changer that is made on the WebStorm plate form\
**GitHub:** GitHub is a web base interface that that uses Git hosting service that allow multiple changes to web pages at the same time\
**Merge:**\
**Merge Conflict:** occur when Git does not which code to use. Merge conflict can also be an event that occurs when git is unable to resolve difference in code\
**Push**\
**Pull:**  Help you collaborate on code with other people\
**Remote**\
**Repository:** repository is a mainstay place for code. It keeps track of all the code and also keep track of all code changes\
